This website has a bug. Suppose you are in the mid level of the home page you got a link of the about page then you clicked on that. Then you redirected to the mid level of the about page. Which is really annoying. If you know what is this bug about and if you have any other suggestions or bugs please let me know in the <a href='https://github.com/mustafizurrahma'>Discussions.</a>
